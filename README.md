# Code Smeller
## Long Method and God Class smell detection using features from Code2Seq model

Project for detecting smell in code using 320-dimensional feature vectors extracted from the code2seq model. Extracted vectors are forwarded as input to ML classification algorithms: 
* SVM 
* Random Forests 
* Logistic Regression <br/> <br/>
The output of a classifier is an integer:
 * 1 for code smell 
 * 0 for non code smell
