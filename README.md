# Code Smeller
## Long Method and God Class smell detection using features from Code2Seq model

Project for detecting smell in code using 320-dimensional feature vectors extracted from the code2seq model. Extracted vectors are forwarded as input to ML classification algorithms: SVM, Random Forests and Logistic Regression. The output of a classifier is binary classification integer - 1 for code smell, and 0 for non code smell.
