     **Important:** If the virtual circuit is working and in the
     * PROVISIONED state, updating any of the network-related properties
     * (such as the DRG being used, the BGP ASN, and so on) will cause the virtual
     * circuit's state to switch to PROVISIONING and the related BGP
     * session to go down. After Oracle re-provisions the virtual circuit,
     * its state will return to PROVISIONED. Make sure you confirm that
     * the associated BGP session is back up. For more information
     * about the various states and how to test connectivity, see
     * [FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).

     * and
     * {@link #bulkDeleteVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes(BulkDeleteVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixesRequest, Consumer, Consumer) bulkDeleteVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes}.
     * Updating the list of prefixes does NOT cause the BGP session to go down. However,
     * Oracle must verify the customer's ownership of each added prefix before
     * traffic for that prefix will flow across the virtual circuit.
